<h2>Custom Events</h2>
<p>
    We want to communicate between components that are far away from each other.
</p>
<p>
    We are going to place a sub component here. It CAN communicate to its parent via @Output() and EventEmitter (see components in bindings folder),
    but we are going to use a service instead, to test communication between component that way.
