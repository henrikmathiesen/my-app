<h2>Include bootstrap</h2>
<p>
    I just want to test the different ways to include a non sass file into the project, from a CDN.
    We use bootstrap as an example.
</p>
<h3>We can do one of the following</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Include it in index.html</li>
    <li>Import it in app.scss, url('') is needed</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Remember to use the minified version, since it is not part of CLI build.
</p>
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">COL 1</div>
        <div class="col-md-6">COL 2</div>
    </div>
</div>
